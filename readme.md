# Batch File For Goanimate Remastered 

This GitHub repo was made as a .bat file for a GoAnimate API wrappper called [GoAnimate Remastered](https://github.com/CyberStudioUnited/Goanimate-Remastered)

Instructions:

* Download  the `start.bat` file
* Fork the GoAnimate Remastered Github Repo (You can do that by going to your Command Prompt and typeing `git clone`then copying the repo link. REMINDER: You will need to have Git installed.)
* Copy and paste the Batch file to the GoAnimate Remastered folder.
* And finally, start the batch file, now your cmd should be working and your localhost will be poping up and so, you can get started!
